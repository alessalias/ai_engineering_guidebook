# Practical LLM Engineering — From Zero to Production

A living, hands-on guide to building systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

This repository progresses incrementally from basic SDK usage to
production-oriented patterns such as memory management, retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), evaluation, safety, and cost control.

The focus is **not** on clever prompts, but on **system design**.

## Philosophy

With this project i wanted to have a repository where i could log, stack and show the ever evolving understanding that i have of LLMs from a practical standpoint. 
This is a living-breathing project, meant to go on as far as my knowledge on the matter is, which is sadly not that far as of right now. I pledge to polish, maintain and eventually finish this project of mine. I welcome the reader on this journey of learning we've undertaken. May it be used for the good.

## Structure

- `data/transcipts` — Sample dataset. The contents are taken from CS50x used for embeddings and rag
- `demo/` — Provider-specific implementations structured in icremental, self-contained learning units 
- `utils/` — Shared utilities

Each chapter includes:
- a conceptual README
- minimal, focused code
- explicit scope and limitations

## Credits & Inspiration

This project is inspired by the CS50 AI Workshop and similar educational material and aims to build on top of that.

## Status

🚧 Work in progress — chapters are added and refined incrementally.
